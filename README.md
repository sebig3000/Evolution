# Evolution

Package used for evolutionary optimization.

## Usage

The object that should be optimized has to implement the Creature interface.
The interface includes teo methods, getFitness & evolve.
getFitness returns the fitness of the creature, that is a measurement of how
well a creature performes with it's specific genes.
evolve takes a mutation factor as argument and returns a newborn offspring.
The offspring gene's difference to the parent gene's is proportional to the
mutation factor.

For the optimization a Evolution is needed. It's construction needs an initial
generation of creatures. This pool of creatures should have random genes that
are still in proximity of the expected values.
Then, by calling evolve the weaker half of creature gets replaced by the
fitter half's offsprings by calling their evolve method with the given
mutation factor.
This step is repeated many times with a decreasing mutation factor until the
fittest creature's is within the wanted fitness.

The class NumberCreature is an example creature with a main method that shows
the usage of this package.
